# Ansible-lint is able to recognize and load skip rules stored inside

# on a new line.

  - yaml[line-length] # it's easier to understand/debug the underlying command when it's not broken up, excessively long lines that make sense to split up should be caught during code review,
  - name[template] # task name is being templated, this can be ignored
  - key-order[play] # playbook structure is fine as-is, enforcing key order adds no value

# Ansible-lint does not automatically load rules that have the 'opt-in' tag.
# You must enable opt-in rules by listing each rule 'id' below.
