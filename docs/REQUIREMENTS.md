## Operating System

An Ubuntu Linux operating system is required for the machine that uses the tools in this repository to perform the tasks associated with standing up infrastructure for a SAS Viya platform deployment.

| Operating System | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/) | You must have a user account and password with privileges that enable unprompted `sudo`. You must also have a shared "private/public" SSH key pair to use with each system. These are required for the Ansible tools that are described below. |

## Machines

The following table lists the minimum machine requirements that are needed to support a Kubernetes cluster and supporting elements for a SAS Viya platform software installation. These machines must be running a recent version of Linux and must all be on the same network. Each machine should have a DNS entry associated with its assigned IP address; this is not required, but it makes setup easier.

**NOTE**: The PostgreSQL server that is described in the following table is listed as 1 machine. If you plan to use the internal PostgreSQL server for the SAS Viya platform, this server is not required, but you will need to adjust the capacity of your compute nodes in order to ensure that they can handle the resource requirements of the PostgreSQL processes.

| Machine | CPU | Memory | Disk | Information | Minimum Count |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: |
| **Control Plane** | 2 | 4 GB | 100 GB | You must have an odd number of nodes, 3 or more, in order to provide high availability (HA) for the cluster. | 1 |
| **Nodes** | xx | xx GB | xx GB | Nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. The number of machines varies, depending on multiple factors. Suggested capacities and information can be found in the sample files. | 3 |
| **Jump Server** | 4 | 8 GB | 100 GB | Bastion box that is used to access NFS mounts, share data, etc. | 1 |
| **NFS Server** | 8 | 16 GB | 500 GB | Required server that is used to store persistent volumes for the cluster. Used for providing storage for the `default` storage class in the cluster. | 1 |
| **PostgreSQL Servers** | 8 | 16 GB | 250 GB | PostgreSQL servers for your SAS Viya platform deployment. | 1..n |

### VMware vSphere or vCenter

In order to leverage vSphere or vCenter, the following items are required for use in your tfvars file. You also need Administrator access on vSphere or vCenter.

#### Resources

| vSphere Item | Description |
| --- | :--- |
|vsphere_datacenter | Name of the vSphere data center |
|vsphere_datastore | Name of the vSphere data store to use for the VMs |
|vsphere_resource_pool | Name of the vSphere resource pool to use for the VMs |
|vsphere_folder | Name of the vSphere folder to store the VMs |
|vsphere_template | Name of the VM template to use to create VMs for the cluster |
|vsphere_network | Name of the vSphere network |

#### Machine Template Requirements

The current repository supports the provisioning of vSphere VMs. The following table describes storage-related requirements:

| Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Disk | The `root` partition `/` must be on `/dev/sd2`. |
| Hard Disk | Specify `Thin Provision` to adjust the size of the disk to match the machine requirements that were listed previously. |

### Physical Machines or Linux VMs

In order to provision physical machines for a SAS Viya platform deployment, you must set up ALL systems with the required elements that were listed previously. These systems must have full network access to each other.

## Network

All systems require routable connectivity to each other.

### CIDR Block

The CIDR block for your infrastructure must be able to accommodate at least the number of machines described in [Machines](#machines). In addition, the CIDR block must have the following:

- the virtual IP address for the cluster entrypoint
- the cloud provider IP address source range that is required to support the LoadBalancer services that are created

The following section outlines recommendations for IP address assignments. All machines can have static or floating IP addresses or a combination of these.

### Static IP Addresses

Static IP addresses must be part of your network and will be assigned to the following components that are deployed:

- Kubernetes cluster virtual IP address
- Load balancer IP address
- Jump server
- NFS server
- PostgreSQL server

### Floating IP Addresses

These IP addresses are part of your network but are not assigned. Floating IP addresses are required for the following components:

- Control Plane
- Cluster nodes
- Additional load balancers that are created

## Storage

This section outlines how storage is used by the tooling to create the `local-storage` storage class for use in kubernetes. Currently, there are two such products that are used in the SAS Viya platform system that require local storage, these are **OpenSearch** and **SingleStore**. If these products are going to be in use within your cluster you will need to have local storage active.

### Configuration and Restrictions

1. The disks must be represented as empty partitions - `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, etc. and attached to the machine or VM.
2. The empty partitions cannot be formatted or pre-configured. These partitions must simply be attached and in their raw state.
3. You must supply an empty partition for each local storage entity needed. Currently, if your deployment will include any products that utilize **OpenSearch** or **SingleStore**, you'll need to have these disks available for use.
4. You will need to update ANY transformer being used for the **OpenSearch** or **SingleStore** products to mirror these values. Using `local-storage` as the storage class and adjusting the storage size to mirror the partition created for use.

### Bare metal and virtual machine storage example

The sample output shows how ones bare-metal machine would have its partitions listed for use:

```bash
root@staging-oss-singlestore-03:~# lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
loop0    7:0    0   62M  1 loop /snap/core20/1587
loop1    7:1    0 63.2M  1 loop /snap/core20/1695
loop2    7:2    0 79.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/22923
loop3    7:3    0  103M  1 loop /snap/lxd/23541
loop4    7:4    0 49.6M  1 loop /snap/snapd/17883
sda      8:0    0  100G  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0    1M  0 part
└─sda2   8:2    0  100G  0 part /
sdb      8:16   0  250G  0 disk
sdc      8:32   0  250G  0 disk
sdd      8:48   0  500G  0 disk
sde      8:64   0  500G  0 disk
```

You can see in the above example where the listing of the block devices for the machine `staging-oss-singlestore-03` shows partitions `sbc`, `sdc`, `sdd`, and `sde` are ready for use. They are disk attached to the machine and in their raw state ready for use.

### Terraform storage example

Here is a sample entry that would be included in your terraform tfvars file to define the disk layout example shown in the above [Bare metal and virtual machine storage example](#bare-metal-and-virtual-machine-storage-example). These `misc_disks` correlate to the `sdb`, `sdc`, `sdd` add `sde` disks in the above example.

```yaml
  singlestore = {
    cpus    = 16
    memory  = 131072
    os_disk = 100
    misc_disks = [
      250,
      250,
      500,
      500,
    ]
    count       = 3
    node_taints = ["workload.sas.com/class=singlestore:NoSchedule"]
    node_labels = {
      "workload.sas.com/class" = "singlestore"
    }
  },
```

This snippet shows the four `misc_disks` created on the single store virtual machines.

## Examples

This section provides an example configuration based on the physical-machine and vSphere inventory files that are provided in this repository. You are expected to modify the inventory files to match your environment and your requirements.

### vCenter/vSphere Sample tfvars File

If you are creating virtual machines with vCenter or vSphere, the terraform .tfvars file that you create will generate the required inventory and ansible-vars.yaml files for a SAS Viya platform deployment using the tools in the [viya4-deployment](https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-deployment) repository.

For this example, the network setup is as follows:

```text
CIDR Range        : 10.18.0.0/16
Virtual IP        : 10.18.0.175
Load Balancer IPs : 10.18.0.100-10.18.0.125
```

Refer to the file [terraform.tfvars](../examples/vsphere/sample-terraform-dhcp.tfvars) for more information.

# Cluster Node Pools config
#
#   Your node pools must contain at least 3 or more nodes.
#   The required node types are:
#
#   * control_plane - Having an odd number 3/5/7... ensures
#                     HA while using kube-vip
#   * system        - System node pool to run miscellaneous pods
#   * cas           - CAS Nodes
#   * <node type>   - Any number of node types with unique names.
#                     These are typically: compute, stateful, and
#                     stateless. 
#

# NOTE: For this example ALL node pools are using DHCP to obtain their

### Physical Machine or VM Sample Inventory File

With this example, because you are using physical (bare-metal) machines or generic Linux VMs, you must update the inventory file and the ansible-vars.yaml file for your environment, using the settings provided below as examples.

This example is using the `192.168.0.0/16` CIDR block for the cluster. The cluster prefix is `viya4-oss`. The cluster virtual IP address is `192.168.0.1`.

Refer to the [inventory file](../examples/bare-metal/sample-inventory) for more information.

# Labels/Taints
#
#   The label names match the host names to apply these items.
#   If the node names do not match, you'll have to apply these
#   taints/labels manually.
#
#   The format for the label block is:
#
#       node_labels:
#         <node name pattern>:
#           - <label>
#           - <label>
#
#       The format for the taint block is:
#
#       node_taints:
#         <node name pattern>:
#           - <taint>
#           - <taint>
#
#   NOTE: There are no quotes around the label and taint elements
#         These are literal converted to strings when applying
#         into the cluster
#

## Deployment

The following items **MUST** be added to your ansible-vars.yaml file if you are using the [viya4-deployment](https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-deployment.git) repository to deploy the SAS Viya platform.

You must adjust the `externalTrafficPolicy` value based on the load balancer selection chosen. The valid values are listed below:

| Load Balancer type | externalTrafficPolicy entry |
| --- | ---: |
| `kube_vip` | `externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster` |
| `metallb` | `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` |

```yaml
## 3rd Party

### Ingress Controller
INGRESS_NGINX_CONFIG:
  controller:
    service:
      externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster or Local # Refer to Load Balancer type table above
      # loadBalancerIP: <your static ip> # Assigns a specific IP for your loadBalancer
      loadBalancerSourceRanges: [] # Not supported on open source kubernetes - https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/service-resources/service-v1/
      annotations:

### NFS Subdir External Provisioner - SAS default storage class
# Updates to support open source Kubernetes 
NFS_CLIENT_NAME: nfs-subdir-external-provisioner-sas

## Logging and Monitoring
V4M_STORAGECLASS: local-storage
```

You must explicitly set the value for `V4M_STORAGECLASS` in your ansible-vars.yaml file as shown above to a pre-existing Storage Class (for example: `local-storage`) prior to installing `cluster-logging` or `cluster-monitoring` with [viya4-deployment](https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-deployment.git).

While other storage classes can be used, the `local-storage` class is **recommended** for the Viya Monitoring and Logging tools.

## Third-Party Tools

The third-party applications that are listed in the following table are supported for the deployment of the SAS Viya platform into a cluster configured by viya4-iac-kubernetes:

| Application | Minimum Version |
| ---: | ---: |
| [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) | Core 2.13.4 |
| [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) | 1.4.5 |
| [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) | 20.10.17 |
| [Helm](https://helm.sh/) | 3.12.0 |
