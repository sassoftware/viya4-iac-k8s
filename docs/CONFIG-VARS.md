## VMware vSphere/vCenter

### Terraform terraform.tfvars file

Terraform input variables can be set in the following ways:

- Individually, with the [-var command line option](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variables-on-the-command-line).
- In [variable definitions (.tfvars) files](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-definitions-tfvars-files). We recommend using this method for most variables.
- As [environment variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#environment-variables).

There is no default type for SAS Viya platform node pools. However, examples that are based on SAS recommendations are listed in the example files. Below is a sample of a basic cluster `node_pools` definition that you could use in your terraform.tfvars file.

**NOTE**: These node pools are required for the `node_pools` variable:

- control_plane
- system

Sample `node_pool` entry:

```yaml
# Cluster Node Pools config
#
#   Your node pools must contain at least 3 or more nodes.
#   The required node types are:
#
#   * control_plane - Having an odd number 3/5/7... ensures
#                     HA while using kube-vip
#   * system        - System node pool to run misc pods, etc
#   * cas           - CAS Nodes
#   * <node type>   - Any number of node types with unique names.
#                     These are typically: compute, stateful, and
#                     stateless.

create_jump    = true # Creation flag
jump_num_cpu   = 4    # 4 CPU cores
jump_memory    = 8092 # 8 GB
jump_disk_size = 100  # 100 GB
jump_ip        = ""   # Assigned values for static IP addresses
```

#### NFS Server

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| create_nfs | Creation flag | bool | false | |
| nfs_num_cpu | # of CPUs | number | 4 | |
| nfs_memory | Memory in MB | number | 8092 | |
| nfs_disk_size | Size of disk in GB | number | 250 | |
| nfs_ip | Static IP for NFS server | string | | |

nfs_memory    = 16384 # 16 GB
nfs_disk_size = 500   # 500 GB
nfs_ip        = ""    # Assigned values for static IP addresses
```

#### PostgreSQL Servers

When setting up ***external database servers***, you must provide information about those servers in the `postgres_servers` variable block. Each entry in the variable block represents a ***single database server***.

This code only configures database servers. No databases are created during the infrastructure setup.

The variable has the following format:

```terraform
postgres_servers = {
  default = {},
  ...
}
```

**NOTE**: The `default = {}` element is always required when creating external databases. This is the system's default database server.

Each server element, like `foo = {}`, can contain none, some, or all of the parameters listed. When naming the server element, it must follow a valid naming scheme, the name must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| server_num_cpu | # of CPUs | number | 8 | |
| server_memory | Memory in MB | number | 16385 | |
| server_disk_size | Size of disk in GB | number | 250 | |
| server_ip | Static IP address for PostgreSQL server | string | | This is a required field. |
| server_version | The version of the PostgreSQL server | string | "13" | Refer to the [SAS Viya platform System Requirements](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/sasadmincdc/default/itopssr/p05lfgkwib3zxbn1t6nyihexp12n.htm?fromDefault=#p1wq8ouke3c6ixn1la636df9oa1u) for the supported versions of PostgreSQL for the SAS Viya platform. |
| server_ssl | Enable/disable SSL | string | "off" | |
| server_ssl_cert_file | Path to the PostgreSQL SSL certificate file | string | "" | If `server_ssl` is enabled and this variable is not defined, the system default SSL certificate is used. |
| server_ssl_key_file | Path to the PostgreSQL SSL key file | string | "" | If `server_ssl` is enabled and this variable is not defined, the system default SSL key is used. |
| administrator_login | Admin user | string | "postgres" | |
| administrator_password | Admin password | string | "my$up3rS3cretPassw0rd" | |
| postgres_system_settings | Configure PostgreSQL system settings | list(object({})) | `[{ name = "max_prepared_transactions", value = "1024" }, { name = "max_connections", value = "1024" }]` | Currently `max_prepared_transactions` and `max_connections` are supported configuration values |

**NOTES**:

1. If you enable `server_ssl` without defining either `server_ssl_cert_file` or `server_ssl_key_file`, the system's default SSL certificate and key are used instead. By default, on Ubuntu systems we create a copy of those files and name them `ssl-cert-sas-${PG_HOST}.pem` and `ssl-cert-sas-${PG_HOST}.key`.
    - The Ansible tasks that are performed include copying the certificate and key from the PostgreSQL VM into your local workspace directory.
2. If you are planning to use the [viya4-deployment repository](https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-deployment) to perform a SAS Viya platform deployment where you have [full-stack TLS](https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-deployment/blob/main/docs/CONFIG-VARS.md#tls) configured, make sure that the `V4_CFG_TLS_TRUSTED_CA_CERTS` variable in the viya4-deployment ansible-vars.yaml file points to a directory that contains the server_ssl_cert_file.

Multiple SAS offerings require a second PostgreSQL instance referred to as SAS Common Data Store, or CDS PostgreSQL. For more information, see [Common Customizations](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=itopscdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=dplyml0phy0dkr&docsetTarget=n08u2yg8tdkb4jn18u8zsi6yfv3d.htm#p0wkxxi9s38zbzn19ukjjaxsc0kl). A list of SAS offerings that require CDS PostgreSQL is provided in [SAS Common Data Store Requirements](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=itopscdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=itopssr&docsetTarget=p05lfgkwib3zxbn1t6nyihexp12n.htm#n03wzanutmc6gon1val5fykas9aa). To create and configure an external CDS PostgreSQL instance in addition to the external platform PostgreSQL instance named `default`, specify `cds-postgres` as a second PostgreSQL instance, as shown in the example below.

Here is an example of the `postgres_servers` variable with the `default` server entry overriding only the `administrator_password` parameter and the `cds-postgres` entry overriding all the parameters:

```terraform
postgres_servers = {
  default = {
    administrator_password       = "D0ntL00kTh1sWay"
    server_ip                    = "10.10.10.10"     # Assigned values for static IPs
  },
  cds-postgres = {
    server_num_cpu         = 8                       # 8 CPUs
    server_memory          = 16384                   # 16 GB
    server_disk_size       = 250                     # 256 GB
    server_ip              = "10.10.10.11"           # Assigned values for static IPs
    server_version         = 13                      # PostgreSQL version
    server_ssl             = "on"                    # SSL flag
    server_ssl_cert_file   = "./ssl_cert.pem"        # Path to the PostgreSQL SSL certificate file
    server_ssl_key_file    = "./ssl_cert.key"        # Path to the PostgreSQL SSL key file
    administrator_login    = "postgres"              # PostgreSQL admin user - CANNOT BE CHANGED
    administrator_password = "D0ntL00kTh1sWay"       # PostgreSQL admin user password
  }
}
```

**NOTES**: 

* For bare metal systems in order to leverage the `local-storage` storage class created by these scripts you need to have empty partitions attached to your machines. These disks are used for the `local-storage` storage class created for those applications that need local vs networked storage to run proficiently. If they are not present this storage class cannot be used. Be sure to alter your manifest files to take advantage of this new storage class where its needed.

### Labels/Taints

Labels and taints are applied to each node that matches the label or taint key name. The following examples outline these names and the labels/taints associated with those nodes.

#### Labels

To label your machines as specific nodes, add the following items to your ansible-vars.yaml file:

```yaml
node_labels:
  cas:
    - workload.sas.com/class=cas
  compute:
    - launcher.sas.com/prepullImage=sas-programming-environment
    - workload.sas.com/class=compute
  stateful:
    - workload.sas.com/class=stateful
  stateless:
    - workload.sas.com/class=stateless
  singlestore:
    - workload.sas.com/class=singlestore
  system:
    - kubernetes.azure.com/mode=system
```

**NOTE**: The label on the system node pool is required if you DO NOT want SAS software to run on your system node(s).

#### Taints

To taint your machines as specific nodes, add the following items to your ansible-vars.yaml file:

```yaml
node_taints:
  cas:
    - workload.sas.com/class=cas:NoSchedule
  compute:
    - workload.sas.com/class=compute:NoSchedule
  stateful:
    - workload.sas.com/class=stateful:NoSchedule
  stateless:
    - workload.sas.com/class=stateless:NoSchedule
  singlestore:
    - workload.sas.com/class=singlestore:NoSchedule
```

### Ansible inventory file

The inventory file represents the machines that you will be using in your Kubernetes deployment of the SAS Viya platform. An example and information about this file can be found [here](../examples/bare-metal/sample-inventory).

The following variables are used to describe the machine targets for the SAS Viya platform deployment.

**Note:** If this file was generated as part of Terraform infrastructure creation through VMware vSphere/vCenter, these fields will be prepopulated with values you set in your terraform.tfvars file. For bare-metal, if you already have your machines, and are going to be populating the inventory file yourself, you can start with the [sample-inventory](../examples/bare-metal/sample-inventory) file in this project to help you get started.
